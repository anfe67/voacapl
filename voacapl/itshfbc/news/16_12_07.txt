07 Dec  2016   1. ICEAREA & VOAAREA had a problem if a calculated grid point was
                  exactly 10,000km from the transmitter if the smoothing method
                  was used. The "short path" model is used for distances < 7,000km.
                  The "long path" model is used for distances > 10,000km. Thus a
                  smoothing algorthim was used to cover the distances in between.
                  But there was an "IF" statement that if the distance was exactly
                  10,000km, smoothing was done, but a previous "IF" statement did not
                  calculate the "short path" results. Therefore, a value (that was
                  never calculated) was used, and that caused a floating point stack error.
                  It would be very unusual for a calculated grid point to be exactly
                  10,000km from the transmitter, so this is a very rare occurance.
                  RECAREA did not seem to have this problem because it has a different
                  smoothing algorithm.
